## When will Flarum be stable?

It's impossible for us to say at the moment – there are too many variables! You can follow our progress on the [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap).

<a name="upgrade"></a>

## Will I be able to upgrade from beta to subsequent releases?

Yes! However, the upgrade process may require you to get your hands a little dirty. We'll do our best to ensure it's as easy as possible.

<a name="customization"></a>

## How do I add a header logo, links, or favicon?

Adding a favicon should be as simple as plopping a `favicon.ico` file at the root of your domain. There's no easy way to add a header logo/links right now, but it's coming in a beta release in the near future. Thanks for your patience!

<a name="integration"></a>

## Can I integrate Flarum with WordPress/Laravel/etc.?

Wouldn't it be inte-*great*! Right now it's not possible, but we do hope to work on integrations such as these in the future. If you're a developer, feel free to kickstart the process!

<a name="feature"></a>

## Will Flarum have [insert feature here]? When? Why not?

We would love to build countless features and extensions for Flarum, but first things first: Our focus is on the essentials and stability. Check out the [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap) for an overview of what we are planning to implement.

<a name="migration"></a>

## Will I be able to migrate my forum to Flarum?

Yes, but not for a while. Our focus right now is on getting Flarum stable and feature-complete. Once we're confident that Flarum is ready to be used in production, we'll start building tools to import data from other forum software like esoTalk, FluxBB, phpBB, and others.

<a name="formatting"></a>

## How can I format my posts?

Flarum currently does not have a visual editor – it's just something we didn't get to in time for beta. Rest assured, it is planned and will be available in the core soon.

Despite not having a visual editor at the moment, Flarum does support Markdown and BBCode. Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions used for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts. If you are completely new to Markdown, check out [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help you with formatting your posts on Flarum.

<a name="translation"></a>

## How do I translate Flarum into my language?

We're currently working on documentation for the language pack creation process. We kindly ask that you wait until it is ready before attempting to translate Flarum. Thanks for your patience!
